## How Does Core Data Save Data?
-  **Persistent Stores**
- Core Data saves (or persists) data into something called a persistent store (think storage). The store is where the data lives.

- **Types of Stores**
- There are three different types of persistent stores Core Data supports on iOS:
    - a SQLite store (the default)
    - a binary store
     - an in-memory store.

- **SQLite**
- SQLite is almost always the right choice for your persistent store; it means your data is stored in a SQL relational database, and there are a few handy features in Core Data (like model caching during migration) that only work with the SQLite store. And since you don’t interact with the persistent store directly, you don’t need to know any SQL to use the SQLite store.

- **In-memory**
- The in-memory and binary stores have different characteristics in terms of memory usage and performance. The in-memory store can be appropriate when you have a small data model that can fit in memory all at once and that doesn’t need to be saved to disk – for example a cache.

- **Binary**
- The binary store can be appropriate when you always need the database to be read and written in its entirety—for example if you are using a file format such as CSV.

- **Abstracting the Store**
- Core Data abstracts the persistent store's details. That means you won’t usually interact with the store directly. You can think of Core Data as a layer that sits between your code and the underlying store, making it easier for the two to communicate.
- Core Data provides a common interface for saving and fetching data, no matter what kind of store sits below. Whatever type of store you choose, you’ll always use the same Core Data classes to access and manage your data. And you won't need to learn a database-specific language to manage your data; you can do it all in Swift.

## Entities
- An entity is represented by an instance of the `NSEntityDescription` class. This class provides access to a wide range of properties, such as its name, the data model it is defined in, and the name of the class the entity is represented by. In short, the `NSEntityDescription` class gives you access to every bit of information Core Data has about an entity. This brings us to properties.

1 - Entity / Name : is an entity name in data model
2 - class / Name : is a class name that xcode generated
3 - class / Codegen : There is three types  
    - Manual / None :  where developer have to manually create and maintain the changes of the NSManagedObject subclasses.
    - Category / Extensions :
    - Class Definition : Xcode will automatically generate the required NSManagedObject subclass as part of the project’s derived data.

## What Are Core Data Properties?
- The difference is between properties, attributes, and relationships in the context of Core Data. The difference is straightforward. Attributes and relationships are both properties. The term property is used to refer to both attributes and relationships.

> Attributes and relationships are both properties.

## Attributes
- You can think of attributes as the columns of a table in a database. Attributes store the values of a Core Data record. There are several types of attributes, such as String, Date, Integer, Float, and Boolean.

- Every attribute type has different configuration options in the *Attributes Inspector*. The *String* attribute type, for example, allows you to set a default value and to add validation rules. It goes without saying that attributes are much more than the columns of a table in a database.

## Relationships
- Relationships are also properties. Instead of storing values, they store a reference to another (or the same) Core Data record. Before we can add a relationship, we need to add another entity.
